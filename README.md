## 🧑‍💻 Project Overview

This project showcases my **frontend development skills** by recreating the look and feel of Apple Music’s “Listen Now” page.  
The current version emphasizes **layout accuracy, UI polish, and user experience**, while keeping the codebase clean and scalable for future updates.

Due to limited development time, **JavaScript usage is currently minimal (approximately 10%)**, and is focused only on essential functionality such as audio playback and basic interactions.

🚧 Project Status & Development Notes
JavaScript is currently used only for essential functionality
The bottom play button works, and sample songs are included
Images may change on page refresh, as AI-generated placeholder images were used during rapid UI prototyping.

🎶 Full song selection logic (play selected song)
🖼 Stable image assets
🧠 Increased JavaScript usage
🔐 Backend integration (users, playlists, likes)
